# tremolite

Customized blog-like static pages generator.

`tremolite` goal is to be more customizable, faster,
and more explicit [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) alternative.

I have started
thinking about it after my blog needs more than 30 seconds to render and
I had to put some very advanced hacks to meet my needs.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a great way to start.
[Liquid templates](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/) allow to customize
without need to write Ruby code. In `tremolite` you will have to write
`Crystal` code.

## Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  tremolite:
